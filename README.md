Real Time NFL Sports Statistics

Have you ever kept your own box score at a baseball game?  If you have, then this app is for you - only for NFL football games!  
This application allows you to keep running statistics for any NFL football game that you watch.

Click “Keep Score of a Game” to get started.  Then, select the visiting team and the home team of the game that you are watching 
from the respective “Pick A Team” drop down menus.  Then, as an example, the game starts with a running play.  Simply enter the 
number of yards rushed on the play and click the “Rush Att” button and the results are placed in the Total Yards, Rush Attempts 
and Total Rushing Yards in the "Statistics" box above.  If it’s a pass play, enter the passing yards and click the “Pass Completed” 
button.  Again, the corresponding results are entered in the "Statistics" box above.  If the pass is incomplete, click the “Pass 
Incomplete” button.  If the pass is intercepted, simply click the “Pass Intercepted” button.  If there is a Sack, Punt or Penalty 
follow the same procedure as a running or passing play, click the corresponding button and results are entered in the "Statistics" 
box above.  A score?  Click the drop-down menu and select 1, 2, 3, or 6 points and click the “Add Score” button.  The score is 
then entered in the quarter that it occurred and added to the total points for that team under their logo.  If there is a fumble, 
click the “Fumble” button.  If the fumble is lost to the other team, click the “Fumble Lost” button.  Pretty simple once you get 
the hang of it.  When the quarter changes, click the next quarter radio button.  The scores will then be placed in the quarter 
that they occurred.  If a time out is called, click one of the "TOL" check boxes.  Don’t worry, when the third quarter radio button 
is clicked, the full allotment of time outs is reset for the second half.  Same thing if the game goes in to overtime. When the game 
goes final, click the “Final” radio button and then click the “Save Stats” button and the results are stored in the database, which 
can be viewed in the “Game Statistics” menu item.
